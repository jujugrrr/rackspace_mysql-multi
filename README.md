Data_Bag
----------

This directory contains directories of the various data bags you create for your infrastructure. Each subdirectory corresponds to a data bag on the Chef Server, and contains JSON files of the items that go in the bag

##### Create data bag directory

First, create a directory for the data bag.

`mkdir data_bags/secrets`

Then create the JSON files for items that will go into that bag.

`$EDITOR data_bags/secrets/newrelic.json`

The JSON for the item must contain a key named "id" with a value equal to the item. For example,

```json
{
  "id": "newrelic"
}
```

##### Create encrypted_data_bag_secret  

Create a random encryption key: `Openssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\r\n' > encrypted_data_bag_secret`
For your chef clients to be able to decrypt the data bag copy over the secret key to the chef folder on the node

##### Create Data Bag

Use this secret_key to add items to a data bag during a create.  

`knife data bag create --editor /usr/bin/vim --secret-file encrypted_data_bag_secret secrets newrelic`

You may also use it when adding ITEMs from files,  

`knife data bag create secrets`
`knife data bag from file secrets data_bags/secrets/newrelic.json`


Example:

```json
{  
  "id": "newrelic",  
  "license": "000000000000000000000",  
  "apikey": "000000000000000000000"  
}
```
